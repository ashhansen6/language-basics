Basic scripts written in R, Python, and Julia

This repo is an archive of scripts written as I practice coding in R and learn how to code in Python and Julia. These scripts cover a variety of basics, such as reading and writing CSV files, modifying data structures, creating functions, and a variety of other actions.

RnW - This subproject is specifically for reading in data, modifying data sets, and writing data to various files
